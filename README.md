# NUMI Open Design

Open source software doesn't get enough design love. 

There are many possible reasons for this: project maintainers are usually not designers; they're spread too thin to go out and recruit designers to contribute; designers are underrepresented in OSS because it's as accessible and as approachable as it is for engineers.

Whatever the cause, one thing is for sure: OSS deserves more design. NUMI is in a privleged position to be able to both recognize this gap and help fill it. We're a guild of designers on a mission to level up the design of every startup and software project. We've built so much of our tech on the backs of OSS giants^, that we want to give back to the community in the form of design contributions.

For now, this is a pilot program that we're trying with a few friends in the OSS community. If the community values it and we can scale to meet the need, we will eagerly expand.

^ Fun fact: a few pivots ago, we got React Native working on iOS, Android, web, and Next.js -- even before Expo bundler supported non-native clients!
